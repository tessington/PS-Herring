# PS-Herring
Exploring links between Puget Sound Herring and Watersheds

All analyses needed can be run by sourcing the 02-run_herring_analysis.R file
This loads in several functions, many are in the file PS-HERRING-FUNS.R file, but also in the:
- human_by_socklet_fun.R
- Impervious_by_stocklet_fun.R
- landuse_by_stocket_fun.R

The state space fits are saved in the 'analysis' folder, but can be re-run by sourcing the 01-Run_state_space.R file
